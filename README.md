# Text-generated-from-alice.txt
hi. ı want to introduce this repository towards enhance our nlp skill with python.
This repository includes Some preprocessing steps and model scratch using torch library.
well alraigth what did ı do.
I found a text from web (alice.txt) and with this text that have generated a new text as a continuaton.
Alrigth,which steps were placed?
Firstly, I have imported related ibraries for nlp preprocessing and model.Than I have created some functions towards preproceesing steps these functions facilitated pre-procesing steps.
after this sections.we are in prerrocesing step.
preporcessing step purpose that how  can training camputer this sentence. we should that for train model.firstly we must label word which in text.we can do this.we should find all uniuque word that passed preprocessing steps than we should create a dict for encodinf unique words. after all of these steps we have a text that consist of labeld words.
